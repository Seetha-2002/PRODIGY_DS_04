<br>
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

## About Dataset

This dataset focuses on analyzing sentiment at the entity level using Twitter data. Its primary objective is to assess the sentiment conveyed in messages about specific entities. Messages are classified into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. Messages that are not directly related to the entity under consideration are labeled as Neutral. The task involves examining and determining sentiment from tweets and other social media interactions associated with the targeted entity, offering insights into public perception and viewpoints. Such analysis is essential for understanding how entities are perceived across various social media platforms and is critical for activities like brand management, customer feedback analysis, and market research.

## Insights from the Data Post Sentiment Analysis

## Sentiment Breakdown Across the Dataset

The histogram illustrates the frequency of each sentiment category (Negative, Neutral, Positive) across the entire dataset, offering a clear view of the general sentiment trends.

The table and the Histogram show how sentiments are distributed across different topics. This helps in identifying which topics have more positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

### Sentiment Distribution of a Specific Topic

We can find sentiment distribution of any topic. For example, here we have analyzed Facebook and Amazon:

- **Facebook**: 6.7% positive ,30.2% negative and 33.7% neutral.
- **Amazon**: 13.4% positive ,25% negative, 53.3% neutral.

### Word Cloud Insights

- **Facebook**: The word cloud for "Facebook" likely features terms such as "post",
  "twitter","friend" etc. This visualization helps identify key themes and discussion topics related to Facebook.
- **Amazon**:The word cloud for "Amazon" likely features terms such as "gift" ,"video" ,"watch"
  etc . This visualization helps identify key themes and discussion topics related to Amazon.

## Conclusion

This sentiment analysis provides a deeper understanding of the Twitter community's feelings and opinions regarding specific entities. By examining the sentiment distribution across different topics and analyzing the key terms associated with these topics, we can gain valuable insights into public perception and the nature of discussions happening on social media. This information is crucial for understanding how entities are viewed by the public, allowing for more informed decisions in areas such as brand management, customer feedback, marketing strategies, and overall public relations. Additionally, the analysis can reveal trends, highlight areas of concern, and identify positive attributes that are frequently discussed, offering a comprehensive view of the social media landscape.
